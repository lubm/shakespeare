Our proyect allows the user to upload a single zip file in using the /admin 
page. This is only needed if the database is not loaded

Clicking on the Index button will start a MapReduce task and save the results in
the ndb database.
The results can also be seen in a file that becomes available after the 
completion of this job using a link that will appear in the index_link column 
after the completion of job.
For the moment you need to reload the page to see this link. The process takes 
approximately 7 minutes for the shortest shakespeare file (lover's complaint).
We are planning to have users and to allow only admin users to access this page.
This is not implemented yet.


The word search is ready and also the RPC call with Javascript. We don't have 
error handling for this yet.
