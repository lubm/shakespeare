Our project allows the user to upload a single zip file in using the /admin 
page. This is only needed if the database is not loaded

Clicking on the Index button will start a MapReduce task and save the results in
the ndb database.
The results can also be seen in a file that becomes available after the 
completion of this job using a link that will appear in the index_link column 
after the completion of job.

The word search is ready and also the RPC call with Javascript.

Extensions:
	- Did you mean
		Suggest an existing word in the database if the user misspelled
		something. For this it chooses the word at distance 1 that appears the
		most in the shakespeare's works.

Extra: There is an easter egg in our home page :P


**************************      INPUT FORMAT      **************************

Our interface expects a zip file consisting of one or multiple text files. The
first non-empty line of each text file is regarded as the work's title.

**************************      RUN TESTS     **************************

We are using the nose-gae framework to run our tests 
Url: https://code.google.com/p/nose-gae/

This is one of the recomended framekorks in the AppEngine docs for local unit
testing.

For installing noseGAE:

$ sudo easy_install nose
$ sudo easy_install NoseGAE

To run the tests, execute this in the app directory.

$ nosetests --with-gae {test_file_name.py} 

IMPORTANT: because of a known GAE issue 
(https://code.google.com/p/nose-gae/issues/detail?id=60)
the tests in the datastore_test.py file should be runned with this additional
parameter --without-sandbox.
